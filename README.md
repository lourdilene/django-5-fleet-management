## fleet-management

REST API of a Fleet Management Software to query the locations of the vehicles of a taxi company.

- **Technical Details:**
  - Used Python and Django to build the API.
  - Implemented queues with RabbitMQ for optimizing asynchronous tasks.
  - Utilized Celery for background processing.
  - Implemented automated testing with Pytest.
  - Used Docker to run RabbitMQ.
  - Performance optimization strategies, including creating indexes on the location table, table partitioning, and progressive data querying.
  - Endpoint for exporting locations in Excel format, with email notification to the user upon completion of processing.

- **Results:**
  - Significant reduction in endpoint response times through database optimizations and efficient queries.
  - Improved user experience with optimized response times.
  - Implementation of a robust export to Excel functionality, allowing users to obtain detailed reports.
  - Enhanced scalability and performance of the application using asynchronous processing with Celery and RabbitMQ.
